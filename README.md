# Vencra Plugin
This repository is a plugin for Endless Sky, it adds a WIP speices of crab named the Vencra. Below is an attempt at a lore document.

# Draft 100%, in progress, stealing formating from Avgi PR cus I'm new

# Summary

## Vencra Space


The first version of the map was below, it was only in draft, but because the Gengo made it completly impossible to travel through their systems and still fit in lore, we had to scrap it and make a second version, which I like better.

Version 1 <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="2025-07-22_11-19_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20bd6b40-49bd-4bca-b927-08d37db2025f" />

Version 2 <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot_20250814_092916" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d333ba0b-ebf1-4736-8ad5-afaf031431ce" />

Note that the Gengo wouldn't have to interact with the Vencra because they do not have access to jump drives, all trade routes that the Vencra take could safely bypass Gengo space, so this prevents stepping on Gengo lore.

Vencra History

Their timeline will be refreshingly simple, they are a mildly young speices, but have been advencing their technology quickly. Due to the fact that they couldn't leave their space, they never met another speices.

Overall the Vencra are a speices in the range of T ~1.9


Overall, while the Avgi can be considered to be somewhere in the range of T ~0.9-1.2, in some areas they surpass humanity as a consequence of their unique history. Their engines and materials science (in the form of hull HP) are far beyond what humans, and indeed some other species, are capable of, but on the other hand they have a very poor understanding of the hyperdrive, and only have (very primitive) shields and gravity repulsors at all by reverse engineering human technology with human assistance. Thematically, the Avgi are very good at the engineering real technologies and spaceflight methods, but struggle with softer scifi technologies such as shields and gravity plating.

Avgi Outfits

Avgi Ships

Avgi ships are designed to look sharp and stark, a striking contrast to the backdrop of space. Their most prominent feature is likely their glowing, red-hot radiators, which dispel the huge amounts of waste heat from their systems into space. It is worth noting that the Avgi do not have any dedicated cooling outfits, instead relying entirely on the high heat dissipation their ships are given by their radiators.

Due to the Avgi theme of being better at harder, more realistic technology than softer scifi, Avgi ships have much better hull durability than shield strength. As their materials science is lorewise quite good, this gives them roughly human levels of total ship HP. However, this emphasis on armor also makes Avgi ships fairly heavy for their size, something that is only offset by the sheer power of their engines.

Large Avgi ships also have a special capacity called anchor points, which can be used to externally mount certain outfits. Things like extra solar cells, extra radiators, and even a stealth coating can be mounted in limited numbers without using outfit space. However, this comes at the price of adding a large amount of solar heat to a ship, forcing it to consider local stellar geography, and ships can usually only fit a single one of these external outfits at a time.
Boring Materials Science Lore

While Avgi nanotechnology is nowhere near advanced enough to repair structures mid-flight, and more broadly resembles either molecular assembly in hard vacuum or extruding components out of an oil bath depending on the variation, the Avgi have been able to create a variety of useful nanomaterials for their spacecraft. The ships themselves are usually white or grey, either from simple paint or a layer of nanofabbed diamondoid. Avgi ships commonly employ structural materials ranging from advanced alloys (exotic steels remain surprisingly popular) to boron-carbon-nitrogen nanocomposites as their spine.

Armor, which gives Avgi ships a notable level of hull durability, usually comes in the form of layers of diamond nacre backed by thick sheets of tungsten. The former is a capable and cheap option for managing kinetic impacts and the ablative effects of lasers, while tungsten is a popular option as a dense material to attenuate radiation from particle beams and nuclear explosions. Blocks of hydrogenated, boron doped polyethylene absorb what's left of most penetrating radiation, while the ship's fuel and propellant tanks often provide a last line of defense, surrounding the crewed sections of most warships.


What is there to see?

Right now, a rough intro campaign is implemented. Written over three days Extensively planned and carefully developed, it will show you the ropes of Avgi space and give you a little background information on the Avgi and their history.

There's also some interesting sights to see throughout Avgi space and beyond. I won't spoil all of them, but exploring can definitely reveal some cool areas.

This truly is an Endless Sky (I'm sorry)

# Map and placement


# 100% Draft, and random facts, I will be editing


- Their physical appearance Is quite easy to comprehend, as it was another case where everything evolved into crab... They are redish crabs, about the size of a dinner plate..

- They evolved in the deep sea, near thermal vents, their body can withstand extreme heats, but will freeze easly left out in the cold..

- A large amount of crabs breath only water, as they evolved to do, but many can now also breath on land as long as their gills remain moist, this is due to a bacteria they created, that lives in their lungs/gills

I am using the image below as a model, but its subject to change as I add more description...

![3203875](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62cba663-277a-4d8b-910c-21aa2266122b)

A core part of Vencra society is their life expectancy and (idk what to call it)...

Each on lives only 10 years, and their life is rigidly defined into life stages, the first one...

- <insert name here> takes up 6 years of their life, during this they do almost all their growing (although they don't stop until a couple months before they die). They also are sent to schools, of which they will participate very very little. During these first 6 years, they don't have very many original thoughts, but have an excellent memory, so during this time, they will obsorbe knowledge like a spung, but don't a whole lot without being told besides basic functions for life (typical crab stuff)...  They make up the civilian class along with the <insert name>

- The second one <insert name here> takes up 1 year of their life, and is when they become hyper active, almost none stop ideas and actions (I'm thinking a form of adrenaline or chemical in them causes this, slowing pumping through them)... They make up much of the Active class (note, I need a better name, its almost akin to a military class, like a military service)

- After the 1 year cycle, during their <insert name here> they go into (for lack of a better word) retirement, for these remaining 3 years up until they die, they lose almost all interest in their previous passions, and lose a lot of their previous motivation. They still retain their knowledge of how to do things, but will quickly get mentally exhausted from too much change... To be honest, they become so casual and laid back about everything, that you could probably keep one of these guys as a pet as long as told him it was a "intergalactic ambassador" position....  They make up the civilian class along with the <insert name>

Another important society thing to understand is that, these crabs do not think like humans do.

- They are very smart at straightforward things, where their is a clear goal or a clear problem, but on the other hand, they are very bad at vague things, for example, art, since art doesn't have a real way to tell weather it is good or not, they get very lost and can't seem to wrap their mind around it...

- This lack of general missing part of their brain (I need to rephrase this), causes issues when interacting with members outside of their species who do have this, that is to say, its not straightforward as with others, who just grasp it..

- Interacting with the <insert name for the crabs at 7 year mark here> will often come off as overly friendly with how active they are.. And interacting with the <insert name for crabs in retirement here> comes off as rude because of how little they interject into the conversation.. 

- Also as a note, they are extremely not xenophobic, and the same process that makes them work well together without fighting, also extends to others... This is good and bad, because on one hand, it makes them very agreeable, but on the other hand, since they by default very trusting of each other, sometimes they are trusting to a fault with others...

They are big art and music enjoyers, they do have taste, but as mentioned, they are very bad at creating it themselves, now, they do have some art and music themselves, but not much... Here is a way to explain it, when a human makes art, they take inspiration for many different things and combine them, but the Vencra have a hard time doing this, and tend to take inspiration very directly, like a copy...

This means they are fascinated by other species's music, art and culture...

-- Language --

The way their communicate is differently from others, for one main reason, crabs don't have vocal cords... THAT'S WHY THEY COMMUNICATE BY DANCE!!! 

Well not exactly, they just have a form of sign language that sometimes involves moving more then just their claws, so it looks like dancing. Which they do in fact do, they are big dancers.. All this means, that its pretty much impossible to speak Vencra sign language.. But communication isn't impossible, because of translating devices and translators (which due to their extremely good memory, can often learn new languages fast, even though they can't speak them)..

But that is spoken language, their written language is (for lack of a better example) a light graph, I need to figure out more details for this, but, they record things in light..

-- Technology Themes --
The main areas that there tech is themed around are..

- Bacterial, they are extremely adept at bacterial engineering. For medical purposes like sicknesses. For living in different conditions (for example, breathing air). For generating power (their biggest generators run off this tech). For building materials and hull repair. For computers.

- Kinetic

- Electrical

- Mini theme, they are good at light technology through the use of bioluminescence rather then laser light, they use this in there computers and also for fast communication..
