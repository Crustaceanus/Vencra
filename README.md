# Vencra And Hanuls Expansion 
This repository is a plugin for Endless Sky, it adds a WIP speices of crab named the Vencra. In addition it was merged with the Hanuls, a speices of cats.
I'm keeping the lore and info in the lore.md, while I do some planning here in the readme, we hope to turn this respository into a merged PR one day
